Since the visibility of each item should be independent of each other, it makes
sence to add an attribute 'models' to AdminItem which contains the names of
models that support the item. When an item is added to a menu using
AdminMenu.add_item(), there should be a check which determines whether the item
is supported - if not, the item is ignored. To do this, the AdminMenu needs to
know which printer we are using, so I added an optional parameter to its
constructor. If the parameter isn't provided, the menu doesn't ignore any
items.

The changes had to be propagated to all subclasses of AdminMenu and AdminItem.

Possible improvements: the strings in AdminItem.models could be regular
expressions, which would add huge versatility.
